# einszweidrei-claude-kit

> A reusable Claude Code developer kit — an opinionated `CLAUDE.md`, subagents,
> slash commands, skills, and settings you can drop into any project, and improve
> together.

The kit ships **two ways**, because Claude Code's plugin system distributes
commands, agents, and skills — but it **cannot** inject a project-owned `CLAUDE.md`
or `.claude/settings.json` into your repo. So:

- Use the **plugin** for versioned, auto-updatable commands / agents / skills.
- Use the **copy-in installer** to drop `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/settings.json`
  (and, if you prefer, everything else) directly into your project.

You can use either or both.

## What's inside

| Component          | Location                                  | What it is                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CLAUDE.md`        | `template/CLAUDE.md`                       | Stack-agnostic engineering standards — SOLID, KISS/DRY/YAGNI, security, testing, quality gates. |
| Settings           | `template/.claude/settings.json`          | Shared permissions + a commit-audit hook and a session-start bootstrap hook.     |
| Workflow           | `template/.claude/workflow.md`            | The working loop (plan → implement → review → done) and task→agent routing.     |
| Subagents          | `template/.claude/agents/`                | A **curated** ~21 specialist agents in `backend/`, `frontend/`, `infra/`, `quality/`. |
| Stack rules        | `template/.claude/rules/`                  | File-type rules (.NET, controllers, repositories, services, frontend, testing) plus always-on `code-review.md` and `security.md`. |
| Slash commands     | `template/.claude/commands/`              | `*.md` commands (`/claude-audit`, `/kit-init`); format guide in the README there. |
| Audit tooling      | `template/.claude/scripts/` + `hooks/` + `.githooks/` | `claude-audit.py` consistency check, the `pre-commit-audit.sh` PreToolUse launcher, the `session-start.sh` bootstrap, and a `.githooks/pre-commit` for human commits. |
| Project instance   | `template/.claude/project/`               | Per-repo `context.md` profile + `tech-debt.md` register (placeholders to fill). |
| Skills             | `template/.claude/skills/`                | `<name>/SKILL.md` skills (format guide in the README there; none shipped yet).  |

Everything lives under `template/.claude/` as a **single source of truth** — the
plugin manifests point at it, and the installer copies from it.

## Usage

### Option 1 — Install as a plugin

Add this repo as a marketplace, then install the plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add EinsZweiDrei-ai/einszweidrei-claude-kit
/plugin install ezd-claude-kit@einszweidrei-ai
```

Plugin commands are namespaced — invoke them as `/ezd-claude-kit:<name>`. The plugin
delivers commands, agents, and skills, and stays updatable.

> Note: the plugin distributes only **commands, agents, and skills**. Project-owned
> and copy-in-only content — `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json`, and the kit's
> `rules/`, `hooks/`, and `scripts/` (the consistency audit + pre-commit hook) — is
> **not** delivered by the plugin. Use Option 2 to get those.

### Option 2 — Copy into your project

Clone the repo and run the installer against your project directory. The installer
is **Python 3, standard-library only** — no dependencies — and runs the same on
Windows, Linux, and macOS:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/EinsZweiDrei-ai/einszweidrei-claude-kit.git
cd einszweidrei-claude-kit
python install.py /path/to/your/project
```

On Linux/macOS you can also use the `./install.sh` shim (it just forwards to
`install.py`):

```sh
./install.sh /path/to/your/project
```

The installer **self-validates**: its last step runs the kit's own audit against the
freshly-installed files and exits non-zero if anything fails — so you can't end up with a
broken kit. It also stamps the kit version into `.claude/.kit-version`.

After installing, run **`/kit-init`** in Claude Code once. It inspects your repo, writes
`.claude/project/context.md` from what it finds, and enables the git pre-commit audit hook
(`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`) so human commits are gated too.

The installer is non-destructive: it skips files that already exist. To overwrite,
pass `--force` (or set `FORCE=1`):

```sh
python install.py /path/to/your/project --force
```

### Updating an installed kit

To pull a newer kit version into a project **without touching your project state**:

```sh
python install.py update /path/to/your/project
```

`update` refreshes the portable files (CLAUDE.md, rules, agents, commands, scripts, hooks,
settings) and **preserves** `.claude/project/**` (your `context.md` + `tech-debt.md`) and
`.claude/settings.local.json`. It backs up `.claude/settings.json` to `settings.json.bak`
before refreshing it, so you can re-merge any custom permissions. Like install, it
self-validates and re-stamps `.claude/.kit-version`.

With no argument either command operates on the current directory. Copy-in commands are
invoked as `/<name>` (no namespace).
