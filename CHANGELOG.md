## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- **`/kit-init`** — one first-run command that inspects the target repo (stack,
  layout, key libraries, test setup), generates `.claude/project/context.md` (and
  removes its placeholder banner), wires the git pre-commit audit hook, and verifies.
  Collapses all per-project setup into a single step.
- **Self-validating install** — `install.py` now runs the kit's own audit against
  the freshly-installed files as its last step and exits non-zero on FAIL, so it is
  impossible to leave behind an artifact that fails the kit's own audit.
- **`install.py update`** — refreshes the portable kit files to a newer version
  while preserving project state: `.claude/project/**` (`context.md`, `tech-debt.md`)
  and `.claude/settings.local.json` are never touched, and `settings.json` is backed
  up to `settings.json.bak` before it is refreshed.
- **Kit versioning** — the installed version is stamped into `.claude/.kit-version`
  (single source of truth: `plugin.json`).
- **`.githooks/pre-commit`** — a real git pre-commit audit hook that gates *human*
  commits (the PreToolUse hook only sees commits Claude makes). Enabled via
  `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` (done automatically by `/kit-init`).
- **`session-start.sh`** — a toolchain-agnostic `SessionStart` bootstrap hook that
  runs a project setup script (`$KIT_SETUP_SCRIPT`, else `scripts/setup*.sh`) so
  cloud/web containers can install their toolchain on session start; safe no-op when
  no setup script exists.

### Changed

- Cross-platform installer and audit: ported `install.sh` and the bash
  `claude-audit.sh` to standard-library Python (`install.py`,
  `template/.claude/scripts/claude-audit.py`) so they run natively on Windows,
  Linux, and macOS with no Git Bash dependency. `install.sh` and
  `pre-commit-audit.sh` are now thin POSIX launchers that forward to the Python
  scripts (single source of truth). CI now runs the validator and installer on
  both `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-latest`.
- The curated agent roster is now the supported set — the README no longer tells
  consumers to prune it; updates keep every repo's kit identical.
- CI now also runs the kit's own audit against the installed copy and validates the
  `settings.json` hooks block against the Claude Code hook schema (rejecting
  unsupported per-hook fields such as `if:`).
- `install.py` no longer copies `__pycache__`/`*.pyc` bytecode into targets.

### Fixed

- **Audit hook fired on every Bash call.** `settings.json` gated the PreToolUse
  hook with an unsupported `if: "Bash(git commit*)"` field, which Claude Code
  silently ignores (matchers filter on the tool NAME only). The git-commit gate now
  lives in `claude-audit.py --hook`, which reads the PreToolUse stdin payload and
  runs the audit only on an actual `git commit` — and no longer blocks unrelated
  Bash calls (e.g. when Python is unavailable).

### Removed

- `template/.claude/scripts/claude-audit.sh` (replaced by `claude-audit.py`).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- Pinned an explicit `model` to every subagent (quality-first): all application-code
  agents (backend, frontend) and the reasoning-heavy reviewers/analysts
  (`architect-reviewer`, `code-reviewer`, `security-auditor`, `security-engineer`,
  `performance-engineer`, `debugger`) run on `opus`; infra, test-automation, and
  documentation agents run on `sonnet`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- Initial release of the EinsZweiDrei Claude Kit.
- Hybrid distribution: plugin + marketplace manifests under `.claude-plugin/`,
  both pointing at `template/.claude/` as a single source of truth.
- `template/CLAUDE.md` engineering-standards guide (SOLID, KISS/DRY/YAGNI,
  security and testing fundamentals, quality gates).
- Subagent roster under `template/.claude/agents/` (backend, frontend, infra,
  quality), plus a format-guide README.
- Stack rules under `template/.claude/rules/` that auto-apply by file type
  (.NET, controllers, repositories, services, frontend, testing) plus always-on
  `code-review.md` and `security.md`.
- Per-repo project instance scaffold under `template/.claude/project/`
  (`context.md` profile + `tech-debt.md` register placeholders).
- `/claude-audit` command + `scripts/claude-audit.sh` consistency audit and a
  `pre-commit-audit.sh` hook that blocks commits on structural failures.
- `template/.claude/settings.json` (shared permissions + commit-audit hook) and
  `workflow.md` working-loop / agent-routing guide.
- `install.sh` copy-in installer (non-destructive unless `FORCE=1`; never copies
  personal `settings.local.json`).
- `scripts/validate.py` dependency-free validator.
- Project docs: README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY.
- GitHub issue/PR templates and a CI workflow.

### Fixed

- Audit no longer fails a freshly-copied kit: `project/` links are tolerated until
  the per-repo instance exists, and README format-guides are excluded from the
  agent/rule frontmatter checks.
