# Controller rules (API layer)

Auto-applies when editing controllers. Full standards: [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md). Project stack/helpers: [project/context.md](../project/context.md).

- **Thin controllers only.** The action does no domain branching, no data access, and no mapping beyond request↔DTO — it validates input, calls **one** application-layer service via its interface, and returns the result. Business rules live in the service.
- No `DbContext`, EF Core, or repository access in the API layer.
- Accept and return **DTOs**, never entities.
- Validate input (the project's model-validation filter); `[Authorize]` by default — justify any `[AllowAnonymous]`.
- Propagate `CancellationToken` from the action into the service call.
- Let exceptions bubble to the global error-handling middleware — don't catch-and-swallow. Use the project's standard result wrapper.
- One responsibility per endpoint; an action that needs domain branching or more than one service call is doing too much — push that into a service.
- **Breaking API changes** — a renamed/removed field or endpoint, a changed status code, or a narrowed type — are versioned or explicitly flagged as breaking (and called out for the changelog). Prefer additive, backward-compatible changes.
- **Keep the API contract documented (when the project exposes Swagger/OpenAPI):** every endpoint you add, change, or remove must be reflected in the generated spec — XML `///` summary/`<param>`/`<response>` docs on the action, an accurate `[ProducesResponseType]` per returned status code, the request/response DTO schemas, and auth requirements. Never leave the spec describing a route, parameter, or status that no longer matches the code.

Applies to production controllers — the `**/*Controller.cs` glob can also match test doubles, which are out of scope. Applicable gates: [code-review.md](code-review.md).
