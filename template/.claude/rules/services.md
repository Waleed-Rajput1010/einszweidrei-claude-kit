# Service rules (application layer)

Auto-applies when editing services. Full standards: [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md). Project stack: [project/context.md](../project/context.md).

- **SRP:** one cohesive responsibility per service. **Class ≤ ~500 lines, method ≤ ~50, complexity < 10.** If it grows beyond that or mixes concerns, split it.
- Business logic belongs here — not in controllers, not in repositories.
- Depend on **abstractions** via DI; never `new` a dependency; no Service Locator.
- Reuse approved patterns (Repository/UoW, Factory, Strategy, Decorator, Options). Don't reinvent; don't introduce new frameworks (e.g. MediatR) without approval.
- Wrap mutations in the project's transaction handler; services share the scoped Unit of Work.
- Use the project's configured mapper, structured logger, and typed exceptions ([project/context.md](../project/context.md)); never log PII/secrets.
- Async end-to-end; propagate `CancellationToken`. `DbContext` is not thread-safe — no `Task.WhenAll` over a shared context; parallelize only with separate DI scopes.

Oversized services tracked for this project: [project/tech-debt.md](../project/tech-debt.md).
